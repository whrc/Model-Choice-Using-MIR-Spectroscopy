 # Model-Choice-using-MIR
 The scripts contained in this repository can be used to apply advanced statistical methods to test the prediction performance, accuracy and precision of partial least square regression and machine learning models using MIR spectroscopy for 10 soil properties.
 
 The manuscript entitled "Accurate and precise prediction of soil properties from a large mid infrared spectral library" has been developed using the script contain in this repository and is under review in soil systems journal.
